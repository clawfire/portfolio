That's a while now I didn't post about the project but, behind the scene, I worked on the last bits that was missing in the app. 

## Automation

If the automation still can be done with Zapier, I wanted a FREE option to do so. So the app can be 100% FREE if some venues want to use it but can't afford putting money in a solution. That's why I removed, for now, the email notification and wrap everything into Google App Script function. 

I planned to add a bit of code to use G.A.S. email notification service (but it would mostly go through your Google Account used for setting up the sheet & the scripts). Not perfect but will still free to use. 

## Documentation

I shoot and edited a 10min video to show in detail how all of this work. That was a necessary step if I wanted to push my app into the Glide Marketplace. Now waiting for their approval (I hope so üòÅ). It offer the app also free of charge through their marketplace.

If video is not your thing, I put also online [a help center]() with everything to know about the app, how-to and some extra ressources. That's the place I'll add content if some questions received worth sharing.
