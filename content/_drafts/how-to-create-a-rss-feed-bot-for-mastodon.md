title: How to create a RSS feed bot for Mastodon
description: I wanted to create a bot for Mastodon that read RSS feed and post toots,
  turns out it's super simple and you don't have to know how to code.

---
Everything started from [a toot from JoÃ«l](https://chaos.social/@jollysea/109544971382423186) about the new [StroumMonitor](https://zesumme-spueren.lu/resources/stroum-monitor/) from Creos. It's basically a forecast of the electricity network load, and it should help the Luxembourgish residents to adapt their usage depending of it. The forecast comes as a widget you can embed on several websites like [zesumme spueren](https://zesumme-spueren.lu/resources/stroum-monitor/) (save \[energy\] together), an API and a RSS feed.

I took the liberty to [put all of those resources on data.public.lu](https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/stroummonitor-la-meteo-de-lelectricite-pour-une-consommation-responsable/), the open-data initiative from Luxembourg. If someone from Creos reads this, just create an account, then an organisation, and ping me so I can transfert the dataset to you ðŸ™ƒ.

Ok so, JoÃ«l was wondering if we could make a bot, on Mastodon, that would toot about the forecast. I immediately thought about this RSS feed and start assembling something with my favorites no-code tools: Zapier & IFTTT.

## The bot account

First, you need to create a new Mastodon account for your bot. I made one on my own Mastodon instance but you can make it on any server. Itâ€™s perfectly fine.

Then, and thatâ€™s important Mastodon etiquette here, mark the account as a bot. On Settings -> Profile, check the Â«Â this is a botÂ Â» checkbox. I would rather recommend too to complete the profile so people will get more confortable with following you.

Now, we need to create a new Â«Â appÂ Â» for our account , in order to get an API key. Still on Settings -> Development -> New app.

You just need a name and to uncheck all the permission except `write`.  More specifically, you can only check `write:statuses`. Leave all the other fields as it is and save.

You now have the application created, and on the details you can see App ID, Secret and Access token. Thatâ€™s what we gonna need later!

## The no-code service

Okay so, hereâ€™s the deal. My favorite service to do that would have been [Zapier](https://zapier.com/). Unfortunately, using Webhooks to post content on Mastodon is a premium feature. While I do have a premium account, I want to show you how to do it for free. So we gonna use the more simple platform [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/join?referral_code=DPqXQkwEOeVzx-z84a8IlV8il7veJg6P) .

Letâ€™s click Â«Â CreateÂ Â»
![](/img/2022/12/ef83f08a-460a-4568-8a2a-5bdb385d25e1.png)
And choose **RSS** for the Â«Â If ThisÂ Â» part

Then Â«Â New feed itemÂ Â» and paste the RSS url  `https://www.creos-net.lu/rss/stroumMonitor` and click Â«Â Create triggerÂ Â»

![](/img/2022/12/9454416e-d793-4eef-b007-251e0c37e8c8.png)
Now select Add in the Â«Â Then ThatÂ Â»  part and choose  **Webhooks** and Â«Â Make a web requestÂ Â».  Now fill those fields like instructed below:

* **URL** is `[your instance url]/api/v1/statuses?access_token=[the access token we talked before]`. In my case itâ€™s then `https://m.thibau.lt/api/v1/statuses?access_token=[mytoken]`
* **Method** should be `POST`
* **Content Type** should be `application/json`
* **Additional Headers** should be empty
* **Body** should be your text, using the Â«Â add ingredientÂ Â» button. In my case itâ€™s `[EntryTitle] pour le [EntryContent]`.  Why that? Simply because `EntryTitle` contain the text Â«Â PrÃ©visions de la charge nationaleÂ Â»  and the `EntryContent` is date and forecast like Â«Â Mardi - 20 dÃ©cembre 2022 - Statut vert : SystÃ¨me Ã©lectrique en Ã©quilibre - Soyons toutefois conscients de notre consommationÂ Â»

Save and â€¦ TADAAAA

So, bit of explanation here. For every new RSS item, IFTTT will send a `POST` request to your Mastodon instance, to the statuses (toots) endpoint, using your access token so the server will know where to write the toot. Thatâ€™s all.

## Going further & ressources

Obviously you can adapt this with any kind of trigger you want, thanks to the power of IFTTT. New tweet, new Facebook Status, new email received â€¦ or new reading in some smart IoT device.

I put under the ressources to the Creos open-data on the Luxembourgish portal, and my reuse. If you wanna check on it ðŸ˜ƒ.
