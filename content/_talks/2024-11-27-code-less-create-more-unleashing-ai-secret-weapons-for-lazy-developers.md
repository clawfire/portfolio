As I gear up for [SymfonyCon 2024 in Vienna](https://live.symfony.com/2024-vienna-con/), I'm thrilled to share that I'll be presenting a talk titled "[Code Less, Create More: Unleashing AI's Secret Weapons for Lazy Developers](https://live.symfony.com/2024-vienna-con/schedule/code-less-create-more-unleashing-ai-secret-weapons-for-lazy-developers
location:)." This event is a fantastic opportunity for developers and tech enthusiasts to gather and explore the latest innovations in the Symfony community.

In my session, I'll be diving into how AI is transforming the way we approach development. AI is no longer just a futuristic concept; it's a practical tool that can significantly enhance our productivity and creativity. As developers, we often find ourselves bogged down by repetitive tasks. That's where AI comes in, acting as a powerful ally to streamline these processes and free up our time for more creative pursuits.

During the talk, I'll be sharing some of the AI tools that have become indispensable in my workflow. These tools not only make coding more efficient but also open up new avenues for innovation. I'll provide practical examples of how AI can be integrated into everyday development tasks, making the process not just faster but also more enjoyable.

One of the key messages I want to convey is that AI is accessible to everyone, not just tech giants or AI specialists. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, there's something in this talk for you. By embracing AI, we can all become "lazy developers" in the best sense of the termâ€”working smarter, not harder.

I'm looking forward to connecting with fellow developers at SymfonyCon, exchanging ideas, and learning from each other. It's always inspiring to see how others are using technology to push boundaries and create incredible things.

If you're attending SymfonyCon 2024, I hope you'll join me for this session. Let's explore how we can harness AI's potential to code less and create more. See you in Vienna!
