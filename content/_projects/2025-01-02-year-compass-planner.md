## The Personal Challenge

Living with ADHD in 2024 meant constantly navigating a world that felt overwhelmingly reactive. I experienced a continuous cycle of responding to whatever was happening around me, leaving me stressed and unbalanced most of the time. With invaluable support from my coach, I knew I needed to cultivate a more intentional approach to life in 2025.

Despite searching extensively—even enlisting ChatGPT's help—I couldn't find a yearly planner that catered to my unique needs as someone with ADHD. So I decided to create my own.

## What Year Compass Offers

### Core Features
* **Quarterly Focus**: Breaking the year into manageable 3-month chunks for better clarity and progress tracking
* **Minimalist Design**: Clean, distraction-free layout that leaves room for creativity while maintaining focus
* **Reflection-Friendly**: Thoughtful structure for mapping goals and priorities without overwhelming detail
* **ADHD-Optimized**: Designed specifically for neurodivergent planning needs and executive function support

### Design Philosophy
The planner embraces simplicity over complexity, recognizing that the best planning tools are those you actually use. Each quarter allows users to:
- Hone in on specific goals and achievements
- Celebrate small victories along the way
- Maintain focus on what truly matters
- Practice mindfulness and reflection throughout the year

## Development Process

### Rapid Iteration Methodology
This isn't just a theoretical design—it's a product built through real-world use and continuous refinement:

* **Personal Testing**: Created and used the planner personally throughout development
* **Iterative Refinement**: Modified design based on actual usage patterns and friction points
* **ADHD-Specific Optimization**: Adjusted layout and structure based on executive function challenges
* **Accessibility Focus**: Ensured the design works for different cognitive processing styles

### User-Centered Approach
The development process prioritized practical usability over aesthetic perfection, resulting in a tool that actually serves its intended purpose rather than just looking good.

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

### Pay-What-You-Want Model
Recognizing that financial barriers shouldn't prevent access to helpful tools, Year Compass uses a pay-what-you-want pricing model. Users decide the value, making this resource accessible to everyone who wants to enhance their planning experience.

### ADHD-Friendly Features
* **Reduced cognitive load** through minimalist design
* **Quarterly structure** prevents overwhelming annual overviews

* **Visual clarity** supporting attention and focus challenges

## Technical Innovation

### Design Constraints
Working within PDF format limitations while maintaining:
- **Cross-platform compatibility** across all devices

- **Screen-readable design** for digital planning
- **Minimal file size** for easy sharing and access

### Accessibility Standards

## Future Development

### Long-term Vision
Year Compass represents the beginning of a broader initiative to create inclusive, accessible productivity tools designed by and for the neurodivergent community. The goal is building resources that actually work for people who think and process differently.

## Social Impact

By offering this tool on a pay-what-you-want basis, Year Compass demonstrates that productivity resources can be both high-quality and accessible. It challenges the traditional model where the best organizational tools are often behind significant paywalls.

The project also contributes to greater awareness and accommodation of ADHD needs in productivity tool design, potentially inspiring other creators to consider neurodivergent users in their development process.
