> **TL;DR**Â : With just **USÂ $5** worth of ClaudeÂ Code prompts I rewrote the README, patched obvious security holes, and added watermarking + bulkâ€‘renaming to my openâ€‘source photo batcher [Superâ€¯Fiesta](https://github.com/clawfire/super-fiesta/). Now it replaces both Photoshop macros and my beloved Squash GUI.

## The original pain point

Except when I'm working with [the great Pit Reding](https://studiopitreding.com), every party left me with hundreds of pictures that were too heavy, not square, unbranded, and badly named. I spent more time juggling Photoshop actions and Squash than enjoying the memories. My tiny Python scriptâ€”hacked together in an afternoon and inspired by [@roast.london.roast](https://www.instagram.com/roast.london.roast/?hl=fr)'s clean aestheticâ€”only did a basic resize and â€¦ that was it.


## What SuperÂ Fiesta does today

* **Resizes** to a neat 1080â€‘px square, centers the photo, fills the background.
* **Batches** an entire folder (optional macOS tag filter).
* **Adjustable** JPEG quality.
* **PNG** watermark (size, position, opacity, margins).
* **Smart** renaming â€” original, sequential, or Eventâ€‘Date with conflict detection.
* **Persistent** config in sf_config.ini.
* **Chattier** CLI with input validation.

## Why I brought ClaudeÂ Code on board

Iâ€™m not a fullâ€‘time Python dev; I wanted to move fast, stay clean, and learn along the way. ClaudeÂ Code bills per token, so with a handful of focused prompts I:

* **Rewrote the README** to be genuinely onboardingâ€‘friendly.
* **Hardened the script** (error handling, RGB/quality checks, context managers).
* **Implemented watermarking** endâ€‘toâ€‘end.
* **Added patternâ€‘based renaming** with a preview step.

Total chat: ~5â€¯800Â tokens  â‡’Â ~â€¯USÂ $5.

## Two signature upgrades at a glance

| Feature | Before | After ClaudeÂ Code |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Watermark | ğŸ›‘ *NoneÂ â€“ I relied on Squash* | âœ… **PNG overlay** â€“ six preset positions, 1â€‘50â€¯% size, 10â€‘100â€¯% opacity (default: bottomâ€‘center atÂ 14â€¯%) |
| Renaming | ğŸ”¢ Batch renamming from MacOS | ğŸš€ **Automatic**: Original / Sequential (`Party_001`) / Eventâ€‘based (`Birthday_2025â€‘08â€‘07_001`) with preview + conflict detection |

## What working with an AI felt like

* **Iterative prompting**Â â€“ start with contextÂ â†’ ask for a planÂ â†’ zoom into code.
* **Git coâ€‘authoring**Â â€“ each commit is clearly coâ€‘signed, perfect for traceability.
* **Security awareness**Â â€“ Claude flagged unvalidated inputs and potential batch crashes and proposed tested fixes.
* **Cost efficiency**Â â€“ payâ€‘asâ€‘youâ€‘go beats a monthly subscription for small OSS bursts.

## Wrapâ€‘upÂ & callâ€‘toâ€‘action
If you want toÂ â€¦

* **Automate your photo pipeline** without a heavyweight GUI,
* **Superâ€‘charge a sideâ€‘project** on a shoestring budget,
* **Learn by reading AIâ€‘assisted code**,Â 

clone [the repo](https://github.com/clawfire/super-fiesta/), run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `python sf.py`. Your shots will be Instagramâ€‘ready in seconds!

> ğŸ’¡ **Next step**: a tiny Tkinter GUI and Windows support. Feel free to open an issue or send a PR.

Happy fiestasÂ â€“ and keep those cameras clicking! ğŸ“¸ğŸ¥³
