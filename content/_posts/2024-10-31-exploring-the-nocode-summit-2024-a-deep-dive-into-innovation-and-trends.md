## Insights from the NoCode Market

The no code/low-code market is experiencing rapid growth in France and Europe, fueled by a shortage of developers, accelerated digital transformation, and the democratization of development tools. Major players like Bubble, Webflow, and Airtable are expanding their footprint in Europe, while local solutions such as Bravo Studio and AppSheet are gaining popularity. According to Gartner, the European low-code market is projected to reach â‚¬45.5 billion by 2025, with an annual growth rate exceeding 20%. This surge is driven by the demand from SMEs, mid-sized companies, and large enterprises seeking to quickly digitize their processes and develop department-specific applications.

## Key Trends Identified

* **Emergence of Open Source Solutions**: Open-source no code solutions are gaining traction due to their flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and the ability to enhance digital sovereignty. While proprietary solutions dominate the market, the interest in open-source alternatives is growing.
* **Public Sector Engagement**: A significant revelation at the summit was the increasing adoption of no code by the public sector. Organizations like the CNES, tax authorities, and educational institutions are exploring no code to empower employees and address unique challenges.
* **Focus on Digital Sovereignty**: The quest for digital sovereignty is a critical concern, with many seeking solutions that ensure data control and security. This presents a golden opportunity for integrators to offer open-source solutions that align with these needs.
* **Maturity of Enterprise Solutions**: no code tools are evolving to meet enterprise requirements, offering advanced security features, compliance capabilities, and seamless integration options. This maturity is crucial for large organizations seeking robust governance and scalability.
* **no code as an Employable Skill**: The demand for no code skills is on the rise, with companies actively seeking professionals adept in these tools. Training programs and certifications are emerging, positioning no code as a valuable and employable skill set.
