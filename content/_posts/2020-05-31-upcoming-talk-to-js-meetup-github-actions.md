Github actions are the integrated way of doing CI/CD and automate anything related to your code repository on Github. From closing those 2 years old bug reports, pinging people on their PR when they are missing something (testing maybe?) to build and deploy your code into your cloud infra, letâ€™s see some possibilities of Actions on Github.
