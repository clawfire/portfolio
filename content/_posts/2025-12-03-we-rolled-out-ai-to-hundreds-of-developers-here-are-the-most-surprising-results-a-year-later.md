For the past few years, every leader I’ve spoken with has asked the same question: what is the real, measurable impact of Generative AI on a development team? At Smile, we decided to move past the hype and find the answer ourselves.

This post is a look behind the curtain at Smile’s journey. What started as a focused, 6‑month study with 60 developers to evaluate AI’s effect on productivity and code quality evolved into a full‑scale deployment across our organization. Over the past year, we gathered a wealth of data—but the most valuable lessons weren’t only in the numbers. They were in the unexpected, counter‑intuitive, and deeply human results we observed. This is the story of how we moved beyond simple metrics to understand the strategic realities of AI adoption at Smile.

## 1. Near‑Perfect Adoption at Smile—But It Wasn’t Magic

After one year at Smile, our developer adoption rate for the AI tool hit an impressive 97.14%. That didn’t happen because the tool was simply “made available,” and it wasn’t a top‑down mandate either. It was the outcome of a deliberate, human‑centric rollout we called the snowball effect.

We treated this as an organizational effort, not just a technical one. Training mattered, so we designed a four‑month program to help developers master a new way of working. We built a core team of 10–15 “allies”—a mix of early adopters and key users who championed the tool. We secured CIO buy‑in to centrally manage and distribute licenses, which was critical for momentum. We aligned with Finance to monitor benefits and with HR to understand impacts on employee experience and recruitment. The result: achieving near‑perfect adoption had less to do with the technology itself and more to do with building a strong, cross‑functional framework for change—at Smile.

## 2. At Smile, Senior Developers Gained the Most

A common assumption about AI coding assistants is that they primarily benefit junior developers by filling knowledge gaps. Smile’s data showed the opposite: the tool’s true power is in augmenting existing expertise, making senior developers exponentially more effective.

On our Drupal teams, the picture was clear:
- For basic templating code, junior developers achieved a 15% time saving. Senior developers reached 30% on the exact same task.
- For complex back‑end and logic‑heavy work, juniors saved 25%, while seniors saw 45%.

This forced a fundamental shift in our strategy at Smile. Our hypothesis: AI assistants don’t just provide answers; they accelerate the workflow of those who already know how to ask the right questions. Seniors can more rapidly validate, reject, and refine AI‑generated code—turning the tool into a true force multiplier for their existing expertise.

## 3. At Smile, Productivity Plateaus Before It Pays Off

If you expect an immediate hockey‑stick productivity curve, you’ll be disappointed. Our rollout showed a nuanced adoption curve. In the first month, developer productivity rose initially, then plateaued. This wasn’t mainly “time lost to exploring the tool,” but a lack of change in working habits. Early gains came from autocomplete and code suggestions, with a dash of chat experimentation.

Developers need time to experiment, build trust, and integrate a new way of working. The real inflection point comes when they shift their mindset and consciously rewire habits. At Smile, the significant behavioral shift—and the measurable productivity gains—started appearing after about two months of exploration. The full ramp‑up time to reach the performance levels we saw in the initial experiment was around four months. Lesson for leaders at Smile and beyond: budget for a learning curve, not a magic bullet.

## 4. At Smile, Human Bias Was Harder Than Integration

During tool evaluations, we uncovered a powerful human factor: developer bias. Asking developers which tool they prefer is not a reliable way to determine effectiveness.

In our case at Smile, many developers loved GitHub Copilot—even when it didn’t make them as productive as other tools. That’s a critical warning: don’t build a stack on brand loyalty or polls alone. Without objective performance data, organizations risk investing in tools that are popular, not powerful. At Smile, we anchored choices in hard metrics, not subjective preference.

## 5. Smile’s ROI Was Huge—and Shockingly Lean to Manage

The business impact at Smile was clear. In the first six months of 2025, the program saved an estimated 1,760 man‑days of developer time across our projects.

Even more impressively, those days were saved during the primary rollout and skill‑building phase. We generated substantial ROI not by waiting for perfection, but by embracing the learning curve itself. The entire transition—from pilot to full deployment, including training, support, and monitoring—was managed with a dedicated resource equivalent of only 0.3 FTE, despite initially budgeting much more. At Smile, a well‑designed strategy kept management overhead surprisingly lean and delivered a powerful return without a large, dedicated team.

## 6. The Invisible Foundation at Smile: Data and Metrics

All of these lessons—from senior effectiveness to massive ROI—sit on one foundation: reliable data. Without rigorous data collection and clear goals, no generative AI project can be steered or justified.

At Smile, we made measurement strategy a prerequisite to adoption. To measure real impact and justify costs:
- Define clear KPIs and objectives before deployment (e.g., cycle time, error rate, productivity on specific tasks).
- Ensure reliable data collection: mechanisms for objective, unbiased usage and performance data.
- Justify the investment: if impact isn’t measurable, ROI is an assumption. Solid data is the only currency for budgets and long‑term validation.

In short, success at Smile depended less on the tool and more on our ability to answer: how will we prove it works?

## Conclusion: At Smile, the Goal Isn’t Just Productivity—it’s Proficiency

Building a generative AI program for developers is a strategic challenge that goes far beyond technology. Our almost two‑year journey at Smile taught us that it demands a deep understanding of user psychology, realistic expectation management, and a robust organizational framework for adoption. Distributing licenses isn’t a strategy.

So our goal is clear: we want Smile’s developers to be truly proficient in AI.

AI tools are becoming fundamental. The question is: are you just distributing technology, or building the organizational mastery to excel with it? If you’re curious about how we did it at Smile—or want to compare notes—reach out. I’m happy to share more of the story and the playbook.
