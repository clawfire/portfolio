Today I'm happy to push online the [COVID-19 Customer Registry page](https://covidluxembourg.app/contact-tracing) on my website dedicated to smart and affordable solutions for small business during the sanitary crisis.

In some countries (like Belgium) those kind of registry are legally mandatory. In France I think it's still optional as well as in Luxembourg. But it's a nice addition to your efforts you are making to fight the spread and I'm sure your customers will be sensible to it.

But mostly what I saw are pen & paper solution, made quickly and without any investment (because a digital solution would be expensive). But during pandemic, asking people to use paper and sometimes even share a pen doesn't seems right isn't it?

**Introducing, the ðŸ†“ COVID-19 Customer Registry !**

Made in an hour during my [#nocode Thursday](https://www.notion.so/nocode-Thursday-f3cc13b34cd94d479e9f0f915fc637cc) steams over Twitch, where I'm exploring using no code tools to solve practical problem and needs, I spend a bunch of extra hours outside of it in order to package it properly and release it to whoever want to use it.
