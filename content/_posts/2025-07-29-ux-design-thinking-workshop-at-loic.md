On September 23, 2025, Iâ€™ll have the pleasure of co-facilitating a workshop dedicated to Design Thinking and UX at the Open Innovation Club of the House of Startups in the heart of Luxembourg.

In a world where technology moves at breakneck speed, designing solutions that truly meet user needs is more important than ever. Design Thinking is a proven approach for creating innovation rooted in real-world usageâ€”at the intersection of what people want, what technology can do, and what makes business sense.
