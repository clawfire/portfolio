For me, sustainability isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a deeply personal commitment. Since **2022**, I’ve been supporting **Direct Carbon Capture (DCC)** technologies as part of my individual efforts to combat climate change. Now, I’m proud to reflect this engagement in my professional work by dedicating **1% of all my business revenue to carbon elimination**, in partnership with [Stripe Climate](https://climate.stripe.com/pUhGw6).

## Why Carbon Removal Matters to Me
The fight against climate change is one of the defining challenges of our time. I’ve always believed that everyone has a role to play, and for me, that started with supporting DCC—a technology that directly captures CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it safely.

DCC represents innovation at its best: using cutting-edge science to tackle a global problem. As someone who works in tech and innovation, I’m inspired by its potential to create a sustainable future.

## Extending My Commitment to My Business

This personal commitment has naturally influenced my professional approach. By allocating **1% of my revenue to Stripe Climate**, I’m ensuring that every project I take on contributes to meaningful climate action. Whether it’s a WordPress website, AI consulting, or 3D modeling, my clients can know that their projects are part of a larger mission to reduce CO2 levels.

## Sustainability Beyond Business

My engagement doesn’t stop there. Since **2024**, I’ve worked to ensure that my non-profit projects are fully carbon neutral, covering:

* **Travel and accommodation** for artists and performers.
* **Printed materials** for events and campaigns.

These efforts reflect my belief that sustainability should permeate all aspects of life—professional, personal, and community-driven.

## Join Me in This Journey

I share this journey not just to inform, but to inspire. If you’re curious about DCC, Stripe Climate, or ways to integrate sustainability into your work, I’d love to connect. Together, we can amplify our impact and create a future we’re proud of.
