## Why I Created This Planner
Living with ADHD, I often find myself navigating a world that feels overwhelmingly reactive. In 2024, I experienced a constant cycle of responding to whatever was happening around me, which ultimately left me feeling stressed and unbalanced most of the time. It was a challenging year, and I knew something needed to change.

With the invaluable support of my coach, I‚Äôve been working hard to cultivate a more intentional approach to my life this year. This journey of self-improvement required me to think a bit ahead about what the upcoming year might look like, even if just roughly. To facilitate this process, I realized I desperately needed a yearly planner that could cater specifically to my unique needs.

Despite my efforts to find something that suited me perfectly, I struggled to locate a tool that resonated with my requirements‚Äîthis included even seeking assistance from ChatGPT! üòÅ After exploring all available options and coming up short, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a planner that would work for me.

While my planner isn‚Äôt foolproof, it has been designed through rapid iterations as I used it, allowing me to refine it based on real experiences and practical feedback. I wanted to share this resource with everyone who might be in a similar situation‚Äîthose who need a little extra help in planning their lives intentionally while managing challenges like ADHD. My hope is that it offers guidance and support for anyone looking to create a sense of order in their busy lives.
