title: 1535° Creative Days — Build a tiny app in 90 minutes (vibe coding workshop)
description: I’m hosting a participative workshop at 1535° Creative Days where we’ll build a small, real app in 90 minutes using vibe coding — AI as a coding pair, you stay in control. We’ll be transparent about the limits and when bespoke engineering becomes the smarter path.

I’m hosting a participative workshop at [1535° Creative Days](https://1535.lu/fr/creative-day-2025) where we’ll build a small, real app in 90 minutes using vibe coding — AI as a coding pair, you stay in control. We’ll be open about the limits and when bespoke engineering is the smarter next step.

## Event details

- When: Sunday, 12 Oct 2025 — 14:00–15:30
- Where: [1535° Creative Hub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SeqCc4V2dvZ9yAPM6), Bâtiment A, Room 02
- Language: English or French (we’ll adapt live)
- Registration: None — just show up

## What we’ll do

- Crowd-sourced idea: we’ll pick one together
- Vibe coding in action: prompt, iterate, test, ship
- Reality check: where this approach shines — and its limits (APIs, auth, testing, maintainability)
- Next steps: when to move from a vibe-coded prototype to a properly engineered app

## Who it’s for

- Designers, founders, makers, students, and anyone curious about AI-assisted coding
- No heavy prerequisites — curiosity helps more than perfect code

## What you’ll leave with

- A working micro‑app built live
- A simple decision framework: vibe code vs. bespoke build
- Practical tips to prototype faster without losing control

## Practical notes

- Bring your ideas; a laptop is optional
- Arrive 5 minutes early for a good seat
- Photos/video may be taken for recap (tell us if you prefer not to appear)

## Why vibe coding?

It’s still coding — just accelerated and conversational. You set intent and constraints; AI proposes. We keep steering. It’s great for exploration and fast demos, but it has boundaries we’ll make explicit.
