title: Replacing my pi-hole with Ad Guard Home
description: I was using pi-hole for a couple of months / years but had to reinstall
  it every once in a while because of gravity being corrupted at some point so I decided
  to replace it and find a solution on how to use this kind of tool on my Android
  phone when at home too.
