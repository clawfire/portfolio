Working as Innovation Evangelist at Smile, it's not always easy to get in touch with our customers or leads, let's say all our business relations, to talk about innovation topics such Blockchain, A.I., computer vision, or new methodologies such as Lego® Serious Play®. 

I'm already involved in marketing events some agencies are doing every year or on a 6-month basis but it's just a small time-window to deliver a lot of content. Usually, during those, I'm doing our inspirational "_State of Innovation_" speech, which we update every time, and showcase some proof-of-concept or prototypes after. 

My colleague Fabien Gasser started a movement in our French HQ in Asnières, inviting startups we sourced and want to work with to make them meet with our salespersons, our tech team, to chat about what they are doing. It's just a couple of hours, every month, and it started to get some traction. He leverages on that and organise small events like this with clients & leads in our Marseille's agency. And to support the talk of our invitee, he starts pitching where we are, what we are doing at Smile and what's the state of the art of the technology linked to this start-up.

## Topics

That's where I joined in the project, to speak about the state of the art of A.I. today, in terms of usage, of projects, and what will be achieved in the upcoming months. You can find more details about this [here](https://thibaultmilan.com/project/ia-today-and-tomorrow "What to expect from AI, today and tomorrow"). 

Since we are both certified LEGO® Serious Play® facilitator, we are also organising LSP introduction workshops during those events.
